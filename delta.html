                <h2 id="capitolo1">A University Project</h2>
                <p>This redesign is my first project as UX Designer and Informational Architect and took place during a
                    lesson where my teacher, Raffaele Boiano, challenged me and my classmates to study the current paper
                    version of the Delta Airlines Boarding Pass to make an improved version that could enhance the
                    overall experience for both passengers and airport operators.

                    <br><br>For this assignment I had 1 hour and 30 minutes to develop a fully functional prototype.
                    During this time I had to follow different steps that could summarize as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Study and Research</li>
                    <li>Sketching ideas and Prototype</li>
                    <li>Testing and Re-sketching iterating on users feedbacks</li>
                </ul>



            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo2">Analyzing the Ticket</h2>
                <p>The paper version of the Delta Airlines boarding pass is extremely confusing, with information
                    printed out without any clear structure or hierarchy.
                    <br><br>
                    This lack of clear organization results in significant cognitive effort when browsing for essential
                    details such as the flight number, gate, or departure time—information that should be the easiest
                    one to grasp.
                    <br><br>
                    There are four key pain points in the current design where our attention must be addressed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of visual hierarchy</li>
                    <li>Poor Redability</li>
                    <li>Information Overload</li>
                    <li>Disorganized Layout</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Overall, this ticket can be described as quite disorganized. However, this issue prompted me to
                    conduct research and ask important questions that guided me through the redesign process.

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo3">Observations and Considerations</h2>
                <p>Before starting a redesign, it's crucial to understand what we are redesigning and who the redesign
                    is for.
                    <br><br>
                    This challenge began with a brief from my teacher, who introduced the company and the main problem
                    they were trying to solve (note: this was a simulation). During the brief, I took notes and
                    identified two key elements among all the information provided:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Delta Airlines aims to provide the most comfortable and valuable travel experience by offering
                        passengers a range of comforts and benefits that are uncommon among other airlines, such as
                        in-flight infotainment and access to private lounges at all the airports where the company
                        operates.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>According to the data presented during the brief, approximately 1% of passengers worldwide miss
                        their flights due to unclear infrastructural information about their own flights.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    These two key points directed my primary focus towards the passenger experience, setting my goal to
                    create something unique and valuable.

                    However, the data gathered during the brief were not sufficient to begin my initial sketches.
                    <br><br>
                    Why?
                    Because I didn't know if there were any technical constraints. While examining the ticket, I noticed
                    several elements, such as the absence of color, the repetition of information in two poorly
                    separated areas, and the specific format/layout used by Delta Airlines.
                    <br>
                    To eliminate any doubts, it was necessary to conduct further research using Google.
                </p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Dimensions and Colors:</b><br>
                        The boarding pass is printed at the desk in all airports using standard paper and a thermal
                        printer, which limits the ticket to shades of black and white.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Layout:</b><br>
                        The ticket is designed to be cut or torn by flight attendants or operators. This is a common
                        standard,
                        which is why the layout must present the same information in two different sections.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Updates:</b><br>
                        Have you ever found yourself in a crowded airport where information isn't clearly visible, and
                        you're
                        unsure where to go? This is a common experience, and departure times and flight numbers can
                        change at
                        any moment. How might we solve this problem?
                        <br>
                        To address this issue, I considered different strategies. One was to print a QR code on the
                        ticket that,
                        when scanned with a smartphone or tablet, would redirect passengers to a web app where all
                        flight
                        information is constantly updated through a series of APIs.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Catching Attention:</b><br>
                        The ticket must be in English, as it is the international language. However, according to a
                        study, icons
                        are useful for catching people's attention.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    After this brief research, I had all the essential elements to begin creating my first sketch.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo4">First Sketches</h2>
                <p>
                    While sketching, I kept in mind everything I had learned about the ticket and the company, focusing
                    on the most important elements for passengers, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flight</li>
                    <li>Gate</li>
                    <li>Boarding Time</li>
                    <li>Departure Time</li>
                    <li>Seat</li>
                    <li>Updates</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All of this information should represent the main part of the ticket for the passenger.
                    <br>My first sketch was pretty simple.
                </p>

                <img src="images/Delta Redesign/First Sketch.jpg" alt="Delta Original Ticket" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Initial tests, conducted with people in my room, yielded positive results. The ticket was clear, the
                    information was quickly
                    accessible, and the layout was more organized, but the space was not managed optimally.
                    <br>
                    This was the project I delivered in an hour and a half.
                    In an A-B test, this redesign proved to be a significant improvement over the current version of the
                    ticket.
                    <br>However, it was still lacking something, and I felt the need to spend some extra time refining
                    this project.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo5">My final Redesign</h2>
                <p>
                    To resolve the “space problem,” I decided to develop the same design vertically, which allowed me to
                    gain some extra space to work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the previous sketches lacked an emotional element.
                    <br>
                    During the initial brief, my teacher emphasized how Delta Airlines strives to enhance the travel
                    experience for all its customers by offering a wide range of comforts. According to the data, people
                    choose to fly with Delta Airlines primarily for the travel experience they provide.
                    <br><br>

                    In this context, the journey itself can become a cherished memory—something we want to share or
                    remember over time. The ticket, in particular, can be one of the elements we preserve in our albums
                    or among our keepsakes, helping us relive that day even after many years. It can remind us of who we
                    traveled with, what the weather was like and other customizable details such as the purpose of the
                    trip.
                    <br><br>
                    As a designer, I strongly believe that to create a good design and a good product, we must balance
                    functionality, beauty, and meaning.
                    <br><br>
                    Emotion enriches the user experience, transforming a product from a simple functional tool into an
                    experience that carries emotional and personal value.
                    <br>
                    With all this in mind, let’s look at my final prototype.
                </p>
                <img src="images/Delta Redesign/Frame 14.jpg" alt="Delta Original Ticket" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    The ticket immediatly shows all the essential parts that a passengers needs to check quickly like:
                    Flight, Gate, Board Time and Departs.
                    The seat is represented in the ticket graphically and this can direct all the passengers to the
                    right door or entrance.
                    <br><br>

                    The QR Code allows all the passengers to see directly on their mobile phone or tablet any changes to
                    their flight, gate or departure.
                    <br>
                    The main core of this boarding pass is highlighted with some bold titles and icons. Different font
                    sizes and font weight are used with graphical elements to quickly direct users attention.
                    <br><br>

                    In the right corner we can find a series of secondary information.
                    This corner has the primary scope to make people relive that day even after years. It’s the
                    emotional part I was previously talking about.
                    In this particular redesign I’ve tried to pointed out who we were with during that fly; where we
                    were directed and how was the weather.
                    <br><br>

                    If this was a trip with your girlfriend/boyfriend or if it was a trip with your family or friends
                    the icons will change and it’s that custom part that can helps people to live again that day with
                    Delta Airlines.
                    <br><br>
                    This is not only something that can bring people to not throw away the ticket after their flight but
                    it’s also a sort of anchor that can bind memories to the Delta brand.
