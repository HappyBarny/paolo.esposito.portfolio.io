                <h2 id="capitolo1">About this project</h2>
                <p>In this 48 hours design sprint challenge, me and my fellow Rita were tasked with designing a kids' app for "Fatto in casa con Benedetta," a beloved Italian food blog by Benedetta Rossi. 
                    <br>Our goal here was to create innovative solutions that would make Benedetta’s recipes and cooking tips more accessible and exciting for children aged 8 to 13.
                    <br>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo2">The challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge focused on developing new forms of information and interaction design to enhance the experience of Benedetta Rossi recipes and cooking tips for children aged 8 to 13.
                    <br>The goal was to make her content more accessible and engaging for young audiences, with a strong focus on promoting healthy eating habits.
                    <br><br>Through this project, I explored the intersection of user-friendly design, education, and health promotion, all while keeping the values of simplicity and warmth that define Benedetta’s brand.

                <h2 id="capitolo3">Brand Analysis</h2>
                <p> Before starting the project, we decided to analyze the brand of Benedetta Rossi. "Fatto in casa con Benedetta" is one of the most popular cooking platforms in Italy, followed by millions of people. 
                    <br><br>Benedetta has established a strong personal brand with her own product line, books, a distinct color palette and even an animated series featuring characters designed to engage younger audiences through playful, cooking-themed stories.
                    <br><br>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo4">The insights</h2>
                <p>
                    For this design sprint, we already had a set of assumed personas.
                    <br>
                </p>

                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="images/Benedetta-kids/personas-2.jpg" alt="Personas" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)" style="margin-top: -7%;">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The target audience for this app primarily consists of children aged 8 to 13. Designing for children means creating for a user segment that requires:
                    <br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Constant learning stimuli</li><br>
                    <li>Features that can entertain them within the app</li><br>
                    <li>Lively and extremely easy-to-read interfaces</li><br>
                    <li>Contextually appropriate interactions</li><br>
                </ul><br>
                <p>
                    The app's objective is not only to help them learn but also to provide fun with their parents and educate them about healthy eating.
                    <br><br>
                    During the design phase, we considered how children cook or might cook with their parents, and we created a potential scenario to evaluate opportunities and challenges they might face in a complex environment like the kitchen.
                </p>
                <img src="images/Benedetta-kids/scenario.jpg" alt="Scenario" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This scenario, hypothesized and analyzed for its challenges, helped us understand the strengths an app like this could have.
                    <br><br>
                    The main challenges identified that could lead to the app being abandoned prematurely are summarized as follows:
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of content personalization based on children’s tastes</li><br>
                    <li>Content not suited to the target audience</li><br>
                    <li>Content not structured for learning</li><br>
                    <li>Low accessibility of the app while cooking</li><br>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Once the challenges were identified, it became necessary to define how to communicate with children. 
                    <br>To address this question, we structured a benchmarking phase where ideas from direct and indirect competitors were gathered to help orient the design of the visual communication.
                    <br><br>
                    Drawing inspiration from apps like Duolingo, video games like Cooking Mama, books such as “Il manuale di nonna Papera,” and research on the "Fatto in casa con Benedetta" brand, we decided to incorporate everything that, in our view, could work for the target audience.
                    <br><br>
                    The outcome of the benchmarking analysis indicated that it would be essential to invest time in structuring both visual and textual communication to meet the challenge's goals by building an app that not only encourages learning through curiosity but also helps to establish healthier habits.

                <h2 id="capitolo5">How might we... ?</h2>
                <p>
                    Having all this information in our hands, I started to wonder with Rita how we could act on this insights that emerged and how we could deal with the various pain points that we found during our research
                    <br><br>
                    So we asked ourself, <i>how might we...</i>
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>...create an experience that feels like play rather than work, guiding kids through each recipe step in a way that keeps them engaged and reduces potential frustrations?</i></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>...ensure that the app remains accessible when children are in the middle of cooking, possibly with messy hands?</i></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>...tailor the content so that each child feels personally connected to what they're learning?</i></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>...subtly promote healthy eating habits while still making it fun?</i></li>
                    <br>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>This approach framed all the key problems and opened up opportunities for creative solutions!</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo6">The idea</h2>
                <p>
                    With these guiding questions in place, we began to prototype features that could address each insight. From interactive tutorials and character-guided recipes to a series of voice-enabled commands, we aimed to create an app that would support kids every step of the way, making cooking a joyful, accessible and healthy experience.
                    <br>
                    In summary, the app needed to be:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Kid-friendly,</b> with plenty of interactive elements, animated characters, and playful recipe names that tell a story.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Tailored to our users tastes.</b> The idea here is to make an app that can use gathered data to offer a personalized experience. The concept here is similar to Netflix's approach, by curating recipe suggestions and activities that reflect each user's interests and favorite ingredients making the experience unique and relevant to each child</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Hands-free friendly,</b> with a simple, well-structured voice interface that allows for perfect hands-free control while cooking.</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo8">Developing the prototype</h2>
                <p>
                    For this prototype, we decided to structure a simple journey that a child could experience in the app, from signing up to following the recipe steps. 
                    <br><br>
                    The sign-up process is designed to be friendly, introducing characters from the "Benedetta Rossi Cartoon" to make it engaging while also gathering key data about our user. 
                    <br><br>
                    The data collected will enable the app’s algorithm to personalize the entire experience. During this phase, kids will also be introduced to Cloudy, their personal assistant, who will guide them through cooking with their parents using voice-activated controls.
                </p>
                <img src="images/Benedetta-kids/sign-up-slide.jpg" alt="it shows the sign up process" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <p>The main menu experience is designed to be tailored to each child, much like Netflix’s personalized approach. Based on their preferences and cooking history, the app suggests recipes and activities that match their tastes while also encouraging them to try something new. 
                    <br><br>Kids can explore weekly challenges, spin a fun recipe wheel for random selections, and even plan a weekly menu to help structure a balanced, healthy meal plan. 
                    <br><br>This keeps the experience fresh and engaging while motivating kids to experiment in the kitchen and make healthy choices.
                </p>
                <img src="images/Benedetta-kids/home-slide.jpg" alt="it shows how the information will be showed in the homepage of the app" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <br>
                <p>Each recipe preview offers a quick video overview and key details to help kids decide if it’s the right fit. Important info is highlighted, like whether a parent’s help is needed, how challenging the recipe is, and the estimated time to complete it.
                    <br><br>
                    In the next section, kids can view a simple ingredient list with exact quantities. A handy tool allows them to adjust portions based on the number of people they’re cooking for, making it easy to plan for family meals or individual servings.
                </p>
                <img src="images/Benedetta-kids/recipe-slide.jpg" alt="it shows how the information will be showed in the recipe page" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <br><br>
                <p>Hand can get dirty sometimes while cooking and let a kid touch a smartphone screen with their hands full of flour, oil or butter is not something parents would wants.
                    <br>
                    For this reason we decided to structure the best hands-free voice assistance. 
                    <br><br>
                    In an environment like the kitchen this kind of feature is crucial. With this tool, kids can move through each recipe step using only their voice, which not only keeps them engaged but also frees up their hands for cooking and measuring. 
                    <br>Voice commands guide them forward, repeat steps if they need a little extra time, and provide reassurance that they’re on the right track. This hands-free functionality promotes independence and keeps the cooking process clean and efficient, letting kids focus entirely on the fun and creativity of making the recipe.
                    <br><br>
                    While studyng Benedetta Rossi brand and the way she teaches to grow up people, we noticed a section called “Consigli Furbi” (clever tips) and we decided to repropose this section for kids in a format designed just for them. 
                    <br>Each tip is a bite-sized piece of guidance or encouragement, offering alternatives, substitutions, or little tricks that make the recipe easier or even more fun to follow. 
                    <br>For example, if a recipe calls for a challenging technique, Smart Tips might suggest a simpler method or a handy workaround. If they’re missing an ingredient, the app could recommend easy swaps or suggest fun add-ins that kids might enjoy experimenting with.
                </p>

                onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <p>To keep kids motivated and excited about cooking, the app rewards them at the end of each recipe with a badge and points. 
                    <br>Every completed tutorial or recipe adds points to their profile, allowing them to progress through fun levels as they cook more. The badges represent different skills or achievements, such as “First Recipe Completed” or “Healthy Snack Master,” giving kids a sense of accomplishment and encouraging them to try new recipes and challenges.
