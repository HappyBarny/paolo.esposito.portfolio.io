                <h2 id="capitolo1">About this project</h2>
                <p>This project starts from a 2 weeks University challenge that I’ve started with my classmates: Alessio
                    Viola, Elisa della Chiesa and Sara.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With them I’ve made all the research, analysis, developed storyboards and a scenario where we
                    started to think about a possible solution.
                    <br> The Informational Architecture and the final prototype was developed entirely by me.
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo2">The challenge</h2>
                <p>Local businesses are increasingly under pressure from the vast reach and convenience of large-scale
                    online distributors, making it difficult for them to compete.
                    <br>In a world where customers are drawn to the simplicity of online shopping, protecting and
                    revitalizing local businesses has become a crucial challenge.
                    <br><br>
                    While these businesses offer unique products and services that resonate with
                    their communities, they struggle to match the digital presence and efficiency of larger competitors.
                    <br>
                    The challenge lies in creating a system that not only shields these local businesses from the
                    dominance of online giants but also helps them relaunch and thrive in a competitive digital
                    landscape.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo3">The Research</h2>
                <p> For this project we decided to do a research that aimed to understand how families in the
                    neighborhoods do their grocery shopping.
                    <br>
                    Investigating and researching the needs of local families is here more than essential because they
                    form the backbone of Italian neighborhoods.
                    <br><br>
                    In this context we decided to combine narrative interviews with business ethnography to obtain a
                    comprehensive view of their habits, needs, and challenges.
                    <br>
                    We combined <b>Narrative Interviews with Business Ethnography</b> researches for several reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Insights validation:</b> Interviews provided us with a series of qualitative data that were
                        based on
                        self-reported experiences. Sometimes people’s perceptions of their habits might differ from
                        their actual behavior.
                        <br>Shadowing them during their grocery shopping leads us to validate or
                        challenge the information they shared with us during the interview.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Contextual understanding:</b> Ethnography adds context to the interview data. With Business
                        Ethnography research we could make several observations that could help us explain why people
                        make certain choices that might not come up during the interview.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Catching Unconscious Behaviors:</b> People often have certain habits or behaviors that they
                        are not
                        fully aware of.
                        <br>
                        Making groceries with them allowed us to catch that series of small but significant
                        details that they always do. Through simple observation we captured a series of unconscious
                        behaviors that were crucial for us while we were designing our final product.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Before starting our research, we needed to determine our research focus. We decided to explore four
                    different aspects:
                </p>

                <img src="images/Local Business/Research Question - Quartiere vivo.jpg" alt="Research Question"

            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo4">The Insights</h2>
                <p>
                    Using the data gathered from our research we created different personas to represent key user
                    groups.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <img src="images/Local Business/xLaura - personas (1).jpg" alt="Personas" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="images/Local Business/xLuigi- personas (2).jpg" alt="Personas" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    These two personas became a reference point throughout the design process.
                    <br>
                    To have a more clear vision of the problem we also decided to identify a common user journey map
                    pointing out opportunities and pain points that we have learned directly on the field.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/Local Business/journey loop map.jpg" alt="Scenario" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Our findings clearly show that many people don’t always know their neighborhood as well as they’d
                    like, and they’re constantly on the lookout for fresh, high-quality products. <br>
                    They also want more transparency about the items they buy, especially knowing where they come
                    from.
                    <br>In our research, we discovered that people want to know ahead of time where they can find
                    specific products locally, and they’re looking for ways to make their grocery shopping faster and
                    more efficient.
                    <br><br>
                    This growing demand for a personalized and convenient shopping experience reveals a huge opportunity
                    for an app that connects people with local businesses.
                    <br>
                    By providing better product information, making it easier to discover fresh, locally sourced
                    products, and simplifying the shopping process, the app can help local stores meet these needs while
                    building stronger relationships within the neighborhood.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To sum it up, people:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Aren’t always familiar with their local area</li>
                    <li>Want to spend more time on things they enjoy, and less time on grocery shopping</li>
                    <li>Prefer fresh, quality food</li>
                    <li>Need an easier way to find the products they’re looking for in nearby stores.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Our research didn’t end there. To gain a more comprehensive understanding, we extended our study by
                    conducting a contextual inquiry research with local sellers and small businesses in our
                    neighborhoods.
                    <br>This allowed us to explore the relationship between these businesses and their
                    community in greater depth.
                    <br><br>
                    We discovered that many local events and special offers often go unnoticed by residents as these
                    businesses struggle to achieve visibility in the neighborhood. Despite offering unique products and
                    services, many people remain unaware of what these local shops can provide.
                    <br><br>This lack of visibility and awareness hinders their ability to compete effectively with
                    larger retailers.
                    <br>
                    This gap in awareness and communication presents a clear opportunity to improve the connection
                    between local businesses and the community, aligning their offerings more closely with the needs and
                    preferences of neighborhood families.

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo5">How might we... ?</h2>
                <p>
                    Having all this information in my hands, I started to wonder how I could act on the insights that
                    emerged and how to deal with the various pain points that we found during our research
                    <br>
                    So we asked ourself, how might we...

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Streamline grocery shopping so that people can spend less time on it and more time on what
                            they

                    <br>
                    <li><i>Provide real-time information about where to find specific products locally, reducing the
                            guesswork in grocery shopping?</i></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>How might we make it easier for local businesses to showcase their high-quality products
                            building trust with customers?</i></li>

                    <li><i>How might we help local businesses showcase their events and engage the community in real
                            time?</i></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>This approach framed all the key problems and opened up opportunities for creative solutions!</p>

                <p>
                    Having scouted the main pain points of the customer journey, the areas of opportunity while thinking
                    about the challenge and all the insights that we gathered during our research, the solution came up
                    naturally.
                    <br>
                    We created “Quartiere Vivo,” an app designed to:

                    A good project always start from a <b>good informational Architecture</b> where we can define:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Functional Tree Map
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Taxonomy and Ontology (something really similar to a DB construction with all relationship
                        between entities)
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> A Functional Map</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I will leave here my Miro board with all the main part of my project.
                    <br>Feel free to navigate the board and see all the details.

                    The information architecture played a key role in shaping my prototype and defining the core
                    functionalities of the app, starting with a clear outline of its features.
                    <br>
                    On the Miro board, you’ll find the functional map along with some initial sketches. These sketches
                    provided valuable insights into how the app would work and helped me identify which components to
                    develop in my prototype.

                    The journey for every user begins with an interactive map, designed to help them explore and connect
                    with local businesses in their neighborhood. This map offers a simple, intuitive experience where
                    users
                    can easily zoom in and out or use filters to discover shops, events, and services they may not have
                    known were just around the corner.
                    <br>
                    The focus of this phase is on discovery, making it easy for users to uncover what's nearby based on
                    their location, while fostering a deeper connection with their local community.

                    Users can quickly find local shops that offer the specific products they’re looking for, all within
                    their neighborhood. The app streamlines the search process, making it easy to locate items without
                    the
                    need for extensive browsing.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, sponsored products and deals are prominently featured at the
                    top of search results, giving users instant access to special offers and promotions from nearby
                    businesses, helping them discover great deals while supporting local shops.
