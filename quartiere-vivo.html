                <h2 id="capitolo1">About this project</h2>
                <p>This project starts from a 2 weeks University challenge that I’ve started with my classmates: Alessio
                    Viola, Elisa della Chiesa and Sara.
                    <br>
                    With them I’ve made all the research, analysis, developed storyboards and a scenario where we
                    started to think about a possible solution.
                    <br><br>
                    The Informational Architecture and the final prototype was developed entirely by me.
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo2">Reframing the challenge</h2>
                <p>“Create a system to relaunch and protect local business from online offerings from large scale
                    distribution”.
                    <br><br>
                    This challenge was so wide that it was necessary to reframe it.
                    To do so we started to think about what we already know, what we didn’t and every question that was
                    popping out of our mind.
                    <br>
                    We decided to focus our analysis on families and on Local Business owners. Why? We needed a starting
                    point for our research.
                    <br><br>
                    This initial part lead us to the creation of an Empathy Map and an Envisioning Canvas that could
                    cover the point of view of our two main actors.

                </p>

                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">

                <p>
                    Through Empathy maps and Envisioning Canvas we reframed our challenge with a single How Might We
                    question.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>“How might we transform neighborhood stores into points of reference for local residents meeting
                        the
                        needs of families?”</b>
                    <br><br>

                    To answer this question we needed to do some on field research.

                </p>

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo3">The Research</h2>
                <p> Good research is essential in a UX design project because it provides a deep understanding of users'
                    needs, behaviors, and pain points. It ensures that design decisions are based on real data rather
                    than assumptions, leading to more effective and user-centered solutions.
                    <br>
                    Research helps identify key problems, validates ideas, and reduces the risk of costly design flaws.
                    <br><br>
                    Before starting our research, we needed to determine where to focus. We decided to explore four
                    different aspects of the experience that people encounter in the neighborhood, which we titled:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Obstacles:</b>
                        <br>
                        What obstacles do people encounter when trying to buy something in their neighborhood?
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Buying Experience:</b>
                        <br>
                        What do people consider most important during their buying experience? Which
                        products or services do families prefer to buy online, and which do they prefer to buy offline?
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Behaviors</b>
                        <br>
                        How do people search for products they need in the neighborhood?
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Perception and Values</b>
                        <br>
                        What is valuable to people living in the neighborhood? How do people perceive
                        the neighborhood?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="images/Local Business/research target.jpg" alt="Research Target" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">

                <p>
                    After this step we decided the research technique required to explore these 4 different dimensions.
                    <br><br>
                    In our research we were aiming to understand how families, in a specific neighborhood, do their
                    grocery shopping so we decided to combine narrative interviews with business ethnography to obtain a
                    comprehensive view of their habits, needs, and challenges.
                    <br>
                    Narrative interviews allowed us to engage with participants in a deep, conversational manner.
                    Asking open-ended questions we encourage participants to share their stories and experiences related
                    to their grocery shopping.
                    <br><br>
                    In this context narrative interviews fitted perfectly and were a really powerful tool that helped us
                    to deeply understand personal motivations, preferences, and pain points but it wasn’t enough.
                    <br><br>
                    The Narrative Interview needed to be combined with a Business Ethnography research for several
                    reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Insights validation:</b><br>
                        Interviews provided us with a series of qualitative data that were based on self-reported
                        experiences. Sometimes people’s perceptions of their habits might differ from their actual
                        behavior.
                        Shadowing them during their grocery shopping leads us to validate or challenge the information
                        they
                        shared with us during the interview.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Contextual understanding:</b><br>
                        Ethnography adds context to the interview data.
                        With Business Ethnography research we could make several observations that could help us explain
                        why
                        people make certain choices that might not come up during the interview.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Catching Unconscious Behaviors</b>
                        People often have certain habits or behaviors that they are not fully aware of. Making groceries
                        with them allowed us to catch that series of small but significant details that they always do.
                        Through simple observation we captured a series of unconscious behaviors that were crucial for
                        us
                        while we were designing our final product.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The insights gathered from this combined approach guided the design process and ensured that any
                    solutions, whether digital or physical, were deeply rooted in the actual needs and behaviors of the
                    people in the neighborhood.
                    <br><br>
                    After conducting narrative interviews and business ethnography with residents in the neighborhood,
                    We've decided to gather additional insights by engaging with local business owners and workers using
                    contextual interviews.
                    This technique will further enrich the research by providing a different perspective — those who are
                    on the other side of the grocery shopping experience.
                    <br><br>
                    A contextual interview is a research method where the interview takes place in the actual
                    environment where the activity being studied occurs.
                    For this research, it means interviewing local business owners and workers directly in their stores
                    or workplaces while they are actively involved in their day-to-day operations.
                    <br><br>
                    During these interviews we gathered real-time insights into their operations, customer interactions,
                    decision-making processes, how they manage the inventory and how they handle peak shopping times.
                    This immediately added depth to the previous data revealing even a series of gaps between what
                    businesses offer and what customers really needed.

            <div>
                <h2 id="capitolo4">From Personas to a possible Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Using the data gathered from our research we created different personas to represent key user
                    groups.
                    <br><br>
                    To do so we identified common themes, segmented our audience for age, social status and
                    distinguishing large families from small ones.
                    <br>
                    At the end of this process we ended up making these two different profiles:
                </p>
                <img src="images/Local Business/personas.jpg" alt="Personas" class="img-fluid"
                    onclick="openFullscreen(this)">
                <p>
                    for both of them we made a little story.
                    <br><br>
                    These two personas became a reference point throughout the design process.
                    I’m not gonna lie: at this point we were completely lost. We didn’t know how to transform this
                    problem into a solution. Why? We didn’t have a scenario so we decided to make one.
                    <br><br>
                    Scenario and Personas opened us up to a solution.
                    While we were making the scenario we were trying to clarify specific pain points, unmet needs and
                    business opportunities in the experience.
                    The scenario helped frame the solution in a real-world context, ensuring it was practical and
                    aligned with our personas needs.

                <p>
                    From this point till the end of this project I worked entirely by myself.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve started from the Informational Architecture developing my functional tree map directly on Miro.
                    <br><br>
                    A functional tree map is a visual representation that breaks down the core functions of an
                    application into hierarchical categories. It organizes features from broad to specific, showing how
                    each functionality branches out from the main goals of the application. In this case, the tree map
                    was created using only words, focusing on the essential actions users would need to perform.
                    <br><br>
                    First off I identified the main core functionality and after that I’ve described all the
                    sub-functions related.

                <p>After that I needed to outline the entities and the relations that will occur with them. It’s a sort
                    of DataBase structure that allowed me to visually have a clear view of the project showing how
                    elements should be linked.
                    <br><br>
                    First, I identified the main entities that would exist within the app. Entities represent distinct
                    objects or concepts that the app needs to manage and store data about.
                    <br>
                    Next, I mapped out the relationships between these entities, similar to what you’d see in a database
                    schema. This helped clarify how data points would interact with each other within the app.
                    <br><br>
                    I then created a visual diagram to represent these entities and their relationships.
                    <br>
                    This diagram resembled a traditional ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram used in database design.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                <p>
                    This map made it clear how data would flow between different parts of the app
                    and It ensured that the app’s features were logically connected and
                    that data could be easily retrieved or updated making the system easly scalable and maintainable.
                    <br><br>
                    Note: we should develop this part of the project with a DBA or a Developer to be sure that the
                    structure support all necessary app functionalities and prevent data redundancy.

                <h2 id="capitolo6">Low Fidelity sketches</h2>
                <p>
                    After mapping out the entities and their relationships, the next step was to create a functional map
                    during a wireframe session. This functional map detailed the app’s main functionalities and how
                    users would interact with them, serving as a blueprint for the app’s user interface (UI) and user
                    experience (UX) design.
                    <br>
                    The functional map aimed to outline the app’s key features in a visual format focussing on the
                    user's
                    joureny.
                    <br><br>
                    In this part of the project I created some low-fidelity sketches that represented the layout and the
                    main
                    functionality of each screen inside the app.

                <p>
                    The final step of the project involved creating a high-fidelity prototype in Figma, which brought
                    all the previous planning, wireframing, and functionality mapping into a fully interactive and
                    visually polished representation of the app.
