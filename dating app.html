          <h2 id="capitolo1">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In this project I have worked with my mate Rossana D'onofrio and I'm
            truly excited to introduce you to Woo, a dating app designed to
            revolutionize online dating. <br /><br />
            The online dating market is more active than ever, with Tinder
            hosting 75 million active users monthly and competitors like Bumble,
            Hinge, and Cupid offering unique approaches. Each app focuses on
            specific aspects: Tinder emphasizes appearances, Hinge highlights
            profile depth, and Cupid matches based on compatibility ratings.
            However, through our research—using these apps ourselves and
            gathering feedback via questionnaires—we identified recurring
            issues:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Trust Issues:</b> Users often doubt if the person they’re
              talking to matches their profile.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Passive Usage:</b> Many treat dating apps like TikTok,
              scrolling without engagement.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Short-lived Conversations:</b> Chats often fizzle out quickly,
              leading to missed opportunities for real connections.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Difficulty Transitioning to Real-life Meetings:</b> Users
              struggle to turn matches into meaningful interactions.
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
          <p>
            These challenges resonate with findings like
            <b
              >Tinder’s "Green Flag Research" and Hinge’s annual insights, which
              show an increase in passive users and fake profiles.</b
            >
            For example, 44% of users don’t actively respond to messages, and
            most likes don’t lead to conversations. This disengagement results
            in fewer meaningful matches.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 id="capitolo2">Why Woo?</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Woo aims to rebuild trust and foster genuine connections.</b>
            It’s not just about finding a date but about connecting people with
            shared interests and clear intentions. <br />
            Whether it’s finding a running partner or someone to join a cooking
            class, <b>Woo adapts to user needs.</b> <br /><br />
            We’ve created user personas and
            <b
              >designed the app to encourage interaction and real-life
              meetups</b
            >. By focusing on active participation and shared goals, Woo seeks
            to create a better dating experience. Woo isn’t just about finding
            someone—it’s about building trust and meaningful connections.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 id="capitolo3">User Personas: for who we are designing for</h2>
          <p>
            Using the data gathered from our research we created different
            personas to represent key user groups.
            <br />
          </p>
          <img
            src="images/Dating-app/Aurora Disperata - Personas.jpg"
            alt="Personas"
            class="img-fluid"
            onclick="openFullscreen(this)"
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            src="images/Dating-app/Francesco Solo - Personas.jpg"
            alt="Personas"
            class="img-fluid"
            onclick="openFullscreen(this)"
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            These two personas became a reference point throughout the design
            process.
            <br />
            To have a more clear vision of the problem we also decided to
            identify a common user journey map pointing out opportunities and
            pain points that we have learned directly on the field.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 id="capitolo4">How might we... ?</h2>
          <p>
            Having all this information in my hands, I started to wonder how I
            could act on the insights that emerged and how to deal with the
            various pain points that we found during our research
            <br />
            So we asked ourself, how might we...
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <i
                >How might we revolutionize online dating to address unmet user
                needs?</i
              >
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <i
                >How might we address trust issues, passive usage, and
                short-lived conversations in dating apps?</i
              >
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <i
                >How might we design an app that rebuilds trust and fosters
                genuine connections among users?</i
              >
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <i
                >How might we encourage active participation and shared goals to
                enhance the dating experience?</i
              >
            </li>
            <br />
          </ul>
          <p>
            This approach framed all the key problems and opened up
            opportunities for creative solutions!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 id="capitolo5">The idea</h2>
          <p>
            Woo is built around the idea of reframing the dating app experience
            to meet diverse user needs. Whether you’re looking for love or
            simply want to find a gym buddy or a friend for a cooking class, Woo
            personalizes the experience around what matters most to you.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Limited Daily Interactions:</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Users can swipe on a maximum of 10 profiles daily, with up to 3
                matches per day.
              </li>
              <li>
                This limitation encourages meaningful connections by reducing
                the overwhelm of endless swiping.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <li><b>Focused Conversations</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A maximum of 6 open chats ensures users can dedicate attention
                to discovering and building deeper connections with their
                current matches.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <li><b>Progressive Profile Unlocking:</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Over time, users can unlock additional parts of a match’s
                profile (like in a video game), encouraging conversations to
                continue over multiple days.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <li><b>Encouraging Real-life Meetings:</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Woo promotes real-world interactions by offering features like
                buying tickets for shared activities such as cooking classes or
                live-streamed concerts.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <li><b>Enhanced Profile Verification:</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                User profiles are verified through live selfies, phone number
                checks, and email verification to foster a safer, more
                trustworthy community.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

          <h2 id="capitolo6">The Architecture</h2>
          <p>
            A good project always start from a
            <b>good informational Architecture</b> where we can define:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A Functional Tree Map</li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Taxonomy and Ontology (something really similar to a DB
              construction with all relationship between entities)
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>A Functional Map</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I will leave here my Miro board with all the main part of my
            project. <br />Feel free to navigate the board and see all the
            details.
          </p>
          <br />
          <iframe
            width="768"
            height="432"
            src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/uXjVK-Illj8=/?moveToViewport=21826,-15573,42395,21222&embedId=975983450497"

          <p>
            The information architecture played a key role in shaping my
            prototype and defining the core functionalities of the app, starting
            with a clear outline of its features.
            <br />
            On the Miro board, you’ll find the functional map along with some
            initial sketches. These sketches provided valuable insights into how
            the app would work and helped me identify which components to
            develop in my prototype.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 id="capitolo7">Developing the prototype</h2>
          <p>
            The first thing we did was clarify how the chat should work, based
            on our research. We created a series of sketches and drawings on
            paper to explore how people should interact within the app.

            We decided to focus on one type of user: the classic dating app
            match where you connect with someone you like or want to date. We
            made decisions about how profiles would look, how users would
            interact with them, how sections of the profile would unlock over
            time, and how to notify users that more content was available on
            their match's profile.

            We developed a simple user flow centered on two main goals of the
            app: We developed a simple user flow centered on two main goals of
            the app:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Meet People</b></li>
            <li><b>Find Events to Attend Together</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As I sad before, the app includes features to discover events like
            cooking classes or live-streamed concerts, designed to encourage
            real-life interactions.
            <br />By limiting daily swipes (maximum 10), matches (maximum 3),
            and open chats (maximum 6), Woo ensures users focus on meaningful
            conversations and connections. Over time, users can unlock new parts
            of their matches' profiles, encouraging longer conversations.
            Profiles are verified through live selfies, phone number checks, and
            email verification to create a safe and trustworthy environment.

            Remember: <b>for this project we had just a week</b>.
            <br />
            It quickly became clear that we couldn’t develop a fully functional
            prototype for our entire concept, so we chose to focus on a specific
            portion of it.
            <br />
            We created a user flow illustrating the "Journey of a person meeting
            their next date on our app." This journey begins with the login
            process, demonstrates how the chat functions, and shows where and
            how information about the date is displayed.
